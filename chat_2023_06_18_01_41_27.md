It appears that the bug in this code is likely a typo in the selector for the "image" variable. The selector ".container .product .itemBox .itemTeks" is looking for elements with a class of "itemTeks" within elements with the classes "itemBox", "product", and "container". However, it seems like there may be a typo in the class name, as "itemTeks" is not a common class name. 

If the class name is wrong or has a typo, then the "image" list will be empty, and the forEach loop where the "title" variable is retrieved from the "filter" element using getAttribute() method will not execute properly leading to unexpected behavior or errors.
